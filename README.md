# instagram-hastag-img-scrapper

An Instagram image scraper is a program that extracts images from Instagram using selenium. The program requires the user to provide a valid Instagram access token to authenticate requests to the selenium. Once authenticated, the program can make requests to the web to fetch images from specific hashtags.

The scraped images can be saved to a local directory or uploaded to cloud storage services such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. However, it's important to note that scraping Instagram's data is against their terms of service, so caution should be taken when using this program.
